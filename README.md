## About

PyTrees is a Python implementation of behaviour trees designed to facilitate the rapid development of medium sized decision making engines for use in fields like robotics.

Brief feature list:

* Behaviours, Decorators, Sequences, Selectors, Parallels and BehaviourTree.
* Blackboards for data sharing.
* A useful library of behaviours, decorators, and idioms.
* Serialise to a dot graph or render to ascii/unicode in a terminal.
* Tested on Linux and Mac (YMMV with Windows).

## What's New?

* [2025-11-13] New `ForEach` decorator.
* [2025-11-13] New `CompareBlackboardVariables` behaviour, with comparison expressions that allow callables.
* [2025-01-11] Support for Python 3.12 was added, and Python 3.8 was dropped.

## Getting Started

You can get started on Codespaces (with no mismatched environment issues and in under 5 minutes) [1]:

1. Fork the project to your personal account
2. Click on Code -> Codespaces -> + Create a Codespace
3. Enter the Terminal

```

[1] All of the above will, of course, work in a local environment if you have `poetry` installed.
If you're using `VSCode` you don't even need that, just reopen the project in the [devcontainer](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) and be froody.

## Next Steps

On PyPi:
* [py_trees](https://pypi.org/project/py-trees/)
* [py_trees_js](https://pypi.org/project/py-trees-js/)

Examples:
* [ReadTheDocs - PyTrees ROS Tutorials](https://py-trees-ros-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/devel/index.html) - significantly more edifying than the demos, these incrementally walk through the process of building a decision making layer for a robot. These use ROS2 (sparsely), but merely browsing should be enlightening regardless.

Visualisation:
* [py_trees_js](https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees_js) - a javascript library for building your own runtime visualisation tool

Robotics:
* [py_trees_ros](https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees_ros) - a tree manager and behaviours designed for use specifically with `ROS2`
* [py_trees_ros_viewer](https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees_ros_viewer) - a `Qt/ROS2` implementation of `py_trees_js`

## Releases

* `2.4.x` - New ForEach decorator, new CompareBlackboardVariables behaviour, and callables in comparison expressions.
* `2.3.x` - Support for Python 3.12 was added, and Python 3.8 was dropped.
* `2.2.x` - Selectors, Sequences with and without memory. Improved testing and style/type checking.
* `2.1.x` - Chooser deprecated. API housekeeping.
* `2.0.x` - Blackboards V2!
* `1.2.x` - Trees can now shutdown cleanly. StatusToBlackboard and EternalGuard, Visitors get finalise().
* `1.1.x` - Fixes for setup, tick-tock, viz.
* `1.0.x` - Behaviours, Decorators, Composites, Blackboards, Tree Management and Viz tools.
* `0.y.x` - First open source pre-releases.
